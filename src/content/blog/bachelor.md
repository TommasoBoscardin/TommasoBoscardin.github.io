## Abstract
This thesis presents the operation of a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) system, with particular attention to its implementation based on polarization encoding of light in optical fiber. This technological choice allows to use the fiber optic infrastructure already existing in current telecommunication networks. However, the use of fiber introduces issues related to polarization drift due to mechanical stress and environmental variations. In this context, the use of a polarization controller is analyzed as a solution for compensating these variations. The device is subjected to experimental characterization, with the aim of providing a basis for the future implementation of faster and more efficient polarization compensation algorithms.
